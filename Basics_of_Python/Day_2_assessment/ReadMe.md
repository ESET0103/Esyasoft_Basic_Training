Day 2 Assessment

Problem statement -
    Make a list of tuples where each tuples represents a (x,y) cordinate.
    Run a FOR loop to iterate through the list, store the x and y cordinate value into a variables.
    Compare the variable and print
    if x > y -> The X cordinate is greater than y cordinate
    otherwise -> The Y cordinate is greater than or equal to the X coordinate for point (x,y)

Logic -
    1. Make a list of tuples representing coordinates
    2. Iterate through the list using for loop
    3. implement the conditions via comparing the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate
    4. Print the require statement based on the condition
